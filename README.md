# Gold_Rates_Time-series_Prediction_using-ARIMA-in-R
### Description: Development of machine learning model to predict the monthly gold rates for next two years.
### Tools & Techniques used:  R language, time series analysis, ARIMA model.
If gold prices fall by 30%-40%, the loan provider would need the borrower to put up more gold. The amount of loan value decreases. This leads to less number of borrowers for a gold loan company.
Most lenders offer a gold loan with a value up to 75 percent of the pledged goldâ€™s market value.

What if the customer is unable to meet the shortfall and starts defaulting on loan? The company will be forced to auction off the pledged jewellery at a much lower price in the market. Used household jewellery has a lower value.

Researchers say that past patterns provide an indication of future movement at least in the short run.
ARIMA model is one of the widely used models for predicting the gold price today. The model assumes that the future values of time series have a functional relationship with current values, past values and white noise. The model uses the historical value of the series for prediction.
